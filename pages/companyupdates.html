        <h2>Monthly Newsletter | October 2022</h2>
        <p class="subheading">2022-10-31</p>
        <p>Here is the round up:
        <ul>
          <li>October as always was a time of spooky season... which is why we released our
          limited edition Halloween Partnership with Joey! 5 different Vessels original
          designs were up for the entirety of October. Fortunately for anyone
          who was waiting to purchase and are still undecided, you still have until the end of the day!
          Get on it before it's gone! (Check it out
          before the sale ends tonight at 11:59PM EST.)</li>
          <li>Layer Cake was our monthly special! 10% off for the whole month. Check it out
          before the sale ends tonight at 11:59PM EST.</li>
          <li>Adam Wheelsly is our featured customer of the month! He left us a very
          heartfelt review for the ceramic "The Plissé" Vase and we just thought we had to share
          (with permission of course). He wrote: <br><br>
          "My beautiful mother is one of the most caring
          people on this planet. She has raised me my entire life to care for myself and others
          and just be a good person in general. She has sacrificed so many hours, time, and energy
          to let me be the man I am today. I know it's not Mother's Day by any means, but I believe
          that we should be able to show our bountiful amoutns of affection for each other at any opportunity.
          And so here I was, online, when Vessels popped up on as a sponsored ad on my Instagram feed. I checked it out
          and immediately thought that The Plissé was perfect for my mother. You see in recent years, my mother's
          eyesight has decined so she has let go of her hobbies quite a bit, one of them being gardening.
          I thought, what better way than to show her the beautiful flowers she misses than in this lovely
          textured vase. Anyways, long story short, she loved it and I just wanted to thank you guys at Vessels
          for putting such quality goods out here!"<br><br>
          Adam, thank you! We really appreciate you at Vessels and you're sending such a great message out there. Who says spooky
          season can't also be 'share your love for one another season'? (Maybe with a more catchy name though...)

        <h2>New partnership with Dominick from Ireland!</h2>
        <p class="subheading">2022-10-10</p>
        <p>We are proud to announce that we will be having some decal designs from
          none other than Dominick Patrick! He is an artist from the UK who we thought
          would make amazing decals to go on the vases. We have been working for a while to
          find materials and a warehouse to start producing decals and stickers for your Vessels
          and we think Dominick here is the perfect person to design our first batch! Please give him
          and his designs a warm welcome when they come out on November 29th!

        <p class="subheading">2022-09-31</p>
        <p>Here is the round up:
        <ul>
          <li>Back to school! Our whole site is having a sale since who says
          that back to school time isn't also a good time to get vases!</li>
          <li>Lot's of birthdays in the Fall aren't there? We thought we'd give you guys a reminder that
          birthday coupons are sent out to our members so hop on it! The deals await!</li>
          <li>Shanon Shae is our featured customer of the month! They left us a very
          hilarious review for the glass "The Warp" Vase and we just thought we had to share
          (with permission of course). They wrote: <br><br>
          "Hi there for those reading this review... OKAY IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS VASE JUST SO UGLY-CUTE THOUGH??
          You know like the type of cute that a french bulldog has. It's just so cute that I think I have cute aggression
          for this vase... like I want to pinch it's cheeks... or like smash it on the ground... BUT I swear I won't!!
          It's too precious for that! Anyways, this is a solid 5 stars from me, I cannot get enough."<br><br>
          Shanon, thank you very much! We really appreciate you at Vessels... so long as you don't smash your vase on the ground...
          just kidding! It's yours to do what you'd like with (though we definitely could not promise a refund for that kind of accident)!
